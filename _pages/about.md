I am a graduate stuent in [Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) (LIDS) and [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/) (AeroAstro) at MIT advised by Prof. [Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/). 

My research interests mainly lie in **robot perception** for better scene to inform decision-making. Especially, I'm interested in the intersection of **probability theory** and **deep learning**, aiming to bring exlainable component into neural network through quantifiable uncertainty. 


Before joingng MIT, I was an undergratue student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), pursuing degree of Computer Science focusing on Robotics. I feel fortuntate to work in [CURLY](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/) lab directed by Prof. [Maani Ghaffari](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/). We aims to discover methods for computational reasoning and perception that will enable robots to effectively assist people in common human environments. Besides, I also work closely with Prof. [Chad Jenkins](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ocj/) in [The Lab for Progress](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/).


“君子和而不同” -- "Scholars seek harmony in diversity". Therefore, I'm excited to make friends with diversified interest and background, form collabration, and pursue great ideas. Feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:rhxu@umich.edu).
