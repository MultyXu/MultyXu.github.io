I am an undergratue student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), pursuing degree of Computer Science focusing in Robotics with Math minor.

I feel fortuntate to work in [The Lab for Progress](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/) directed by Prof. [Chad Jenkins](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ocj/) In the lab, we aims to discover methods for computational reasoning and perception that will enable robots to effectively assist people in common human environments. Besides, I also work closely with the Ph.D. student [Joey Wilson](https://joeywilsoniv.com/) advised Prof. [Maani Ghaffari](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/) in the [CURLY](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/) lab. 

My research interests mainly lie in **robot perception** for better decision-making and planning, especially **computer vision** and **mapping**.

“君子和而不同” -- "Scholars seek harmony in diversity". Therefore, I'm excited to make friends with diversified interest and background, form collabration, and pursue great ideas. Feel free to contact me through [email](rhxu@umich.edu).
